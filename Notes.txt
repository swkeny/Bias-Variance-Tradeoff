reducible error   : reducible error can be and should be minimized further to maximize accuracy
irreducible error : inherent uncertainty is associated with a natural variability in a system

reducible error 
1) error due to squared  : the amount by which the expected model prediction differs from the true value or 
	target, over the training data (model selection bias)
2) error due to variance : the amount by which the prediction, over one training set, differs from the 
	expected predicted value, over all the training sets (inconsistencies in predictions over other training sets)

has the math for 

P46: 
"When a given method yields a small training MSE but a large test MSE, we are said to be over?tting the data. 
This happens because our statistical learning procedure is working too hard to ?nd patterns in the training data, 
and may be picking up some patterns that are just caused by random chance rather than by true properties of the 
unknown function f"

"Over?tting refers speci?cally to the case in which a less ?exible model would have yielded a smaller test MSE."

P47: 
Use cross-validation if no test data is available

P48 -49
Variance: Degree to which the model changes as test data changes. Generally More flexible models -> higher variances
Bias: error introduced by approximating a real-life problem, which may be extremely complicated, by a much simpler 
	model. Generally More flexible models -> lower bias

"As a general rule, as we use more ?exible methods, the variance will increase and the bias will decrease. "

Use Cross validation or regularization
